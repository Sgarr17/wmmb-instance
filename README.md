# When Magick Meets Brass
This repository includes all you need to play the *When Magick Meets Brass* modpack.

This pack is built on Forge for Minecraft Java version 1.20.1.

## Requirements
### Prism Launcher
This modpack is designed to be imported into Prism Launcher. By using Prism, I will be able to offer you relevant assistance if needed.

Please download the latest version here: https://prismlauncher.org/download/

(Prism is the best launcher anyway, especially if you have used MultiMC in the past)

### Java 17
I have encountered issues with Oracle's version of Java 17 while playing this pack, and as such ***strongly*** recommend using Adoptium's Java 17.

Please download the latest "JDK" package of version "17 - LTS" here: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&package=jdk&version=17/

(If you use Oracle's Java 17 and encounter a JVM crash, swapping to Adoptium is what solved that for me)

### GitHub Desktop
This repository is designed to be cloned for easy installation with Prism Launcher. To do so, you will need GitHub Desktop (or some other form of Git).

Please download the latest version here: https://desktop.github.com/download/

Note: There will also be releases of the pack that come as a .zip file, which can be manually imported into Prism Launcher.  If you choose to use this method for installing/updating, version updates will require more effort on your behalf.
